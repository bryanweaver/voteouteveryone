# Cleanup: $ARGUMENTS

## Objective

Improve code quality, performance, and maintainability for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Workflow

You will coordinate the lean agile team to cleanup this area following the `/cleanup` workflow:

1. **Cleanup Branch** (Shipper)
   - Create branch: `refactor/[area-name]`
   - Prepare for systematic improvements

2. **Identify Improvements** (Reviewer)
   - Scan for code smells
   - Find performance bottlenecks
   - List refactoring opportunities
   - Prioritize by impact

3. **Refactor Code** (Full Stack Developer or Database Admin)
   - Implement improvements
   - Maintain functionality (no behavior changes)
   - Update tests as needed
   - Document significant changes

4. **Commit Refactoring** (Shipper)
   - Create clear commits for each logical change
   - Use format: `refactor: [description]`

5. **Test and Validate** (Shipper)
   - Run full test suite
   - Check performance metrics
   - Monitor for regressions

6. **Complete Merge** (Shipper)
   - Create PR with before/after metrics
   - Document performance improvements
   - Merge after review

## Instructions for Main Orchestrator

Use the Task tool to launch agents for systematic improvement:

- Start with shipper agent for branch creation
- Launch reviewer agent to analyze code
- Use full-stack-developer or database-admin for refactoring
- Launch shipper agent for testing and deployment
- Include metrics to show improvements

Focus on high-impact improvements, skip minor nitpicks.
